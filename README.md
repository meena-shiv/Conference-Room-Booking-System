# Conference-Room-Booking-System
The Conference Room Booking System is designed to manage the booking of conference rooms in a building with multiple floors. The system allows administrators to add floors, rooms, and organizations and register users under these organizations. Users can then book rooms, view their bookings, and cancel bookings under certain conditions.
